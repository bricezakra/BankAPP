There are 3 types of methods:

- instance methods;
- class methods;
- static methods.



* If we are using at least one instance variable, this is an INSTANCE METHOD;
* If we are using only some static variables for our program and no instance variables, this is a CLASS METHOD;
* If we are not using any instance or static variables, this is a STATIC METHOD.



We can access an INSTANCE VARIABLE by using “SELF”;
example:
def m1(self):
   self.x

We can access a CLASS VARIABLE by using “CLS”;
example:
def m1(cls):
   cls.x
   Test.x

Check out example below to see how to access a STATIC VARIABLE:
example:
def add(x, y):
   print(x+y)
